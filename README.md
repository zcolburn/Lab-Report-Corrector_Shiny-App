# Lab Report Corrector - Shiny App


Word processing programs such as Microsoft Word generally do a good job identifying grammatical errors. However, they tend to do a poor job analyzing the logic that connects structural units larger than a sentence. In order to help students identify these issues and get real-time feedback describing the issue and how to remedy it, I created this R Shiny Web App. It works by identifying text that is often associated with structural errors.
